Task 2: Bad identifiers

03/17/2020  
is indeed a bad variable name. The '/' char is reserved for arithmetic operations ( here division ) and is interpreted as such. Forbidden to use in variable declarations

CourseNumberJava
does not follow the "lowerCamelCase"-notation that is used for easy readability. Better: javaCourseNumber

best grade in SS20
spaces are definitely not allowed in variable declaration and would throw an error.

1stAttestation
declared variables cannot start with a digit number.

fußgröße
I assume characters like 'ß' and 'ö' that are not universal should not be used when declaring a variable.

bestaveragerating
does not follow the "lowerCamelCase"-notation. Better: bestAverageRating.

netto+VAT
The plus operator is reserved for arithmetic operations and cannot be used when declaring variables.

s
Is no meaningful word and thus should not be used when declaring a variable. It is not clear to what a value 's' might referece.

Task 3:

double creditAccountBalance;
int orderedArticleQuantity;
String vehicleTyreDot;
float monthlyInstalmentRate;
String matriculationNumber;
